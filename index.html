	<p> Many city, state and local officials agree that Rikers must be closed. Advocates for the receivership state that this would enable sweeping changes such as firing of chronically absent correctional officers. Attorney Hernandez Shroud describes receivership as “Judges typically give receivers wide-ranging authority such as the power to manage staff, make contracts, access government records, conduct confidential interviews, procure goods, and set budgets.”</p>

<p> A Federal receivership would mean that Swain would appoint a neutral expert to make unilateral decisions. A receivership is used to bring an institution in compliance with the law. </p>

<p> The worry is that the receiver would be unprepared for addressing issues on Rikers. Darren Mack, co-founder of Freedom Agenda, a non profit member led organization that advocated for Rikers shut down. “This mayor has been in office and things have not improved. People are still lingering in inhumane conditions.” Mack states we need to address the human rights concerns now and close Rikers Island. </p>

<p> Mack was previously held on Rikers Island and states the goal is to close the prison pipeline by directly investing in impacted communities. Mack said “We know the most resourced communities are the safest communities.’’ Mack spoke earlier this month at a Columbia University panel discussion that discussed the dysfunction of Rikers Island and the judicial courts that interned prisoners. Mack said the mayor must review the budget recommendations made in the community reinvestment report. </p>

<p> Founder of Vital City Liz Glazer said their data shows the numbers of fights, slashing, stabbings at Rikers attributing to the jail’s deterioration during COVID. She said understaffing exacerbates Riker’s inhumane conditions. Former Rikers Chief Investigator Serena Townsend said at Rikers Island today 85% of detainees have not been charged yet 70% miss their court date due to understaffing. Staff absenteeism is over 12% and stabbings have increased by 30%. </p>
